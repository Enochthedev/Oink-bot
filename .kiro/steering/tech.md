# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies
- **Kiro AI Assistant**: Primary development environment
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Enabled for server integration and tool development
- **JSON Configuration**: Used for settings and MCP server definitions

## Configuration Files
- `.vscode/settings.json`: VSCode workspace settings with Kiro MCP configuration enabled
- `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`: MCP server configurations (workspace-level)
- `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`: Global MCP server configurations (user-level)

## Common Commands
Since this is a Kiro-focused workspace, most operations are performed through the AI assistant interface:

### MCP Operations
- Use Kiro command palette: Search for "MCP" commands
- Test MCP tools directly through chat interactions
- Configure servers via JSON files in `.kiro/settings/`

### Development Workflow
- Interact with Kiro through chat interface
- Use steering files to guide AI behavior
- Test and iterate on MCP server configurations
- Leverage Kiro's file manipulation and analysis capabilities
