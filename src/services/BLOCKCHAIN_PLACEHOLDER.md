# Blockchain Services - Future Implementation

## Overview
This file serves as a placeholder for blockchain-related services that were temporarily removed to resolve build issues.

## Services to Implement Later
- `EthereumProvider` - Ethereum blockchain interaction service
- `BlockchainEscrowService` - Blockchain-based escrow management
- `NonCustodialEscrowManager` - Non-custodial escrow implementation
- `EscrowContractABI` - Smart contract ABI definitions

## Implementation Notes
- These services are not essential for core bot functionality
- They can be added back once the build system is stable
- Consider implementing as optional/feature-flagged services
- Ensure proper error handling for when blockchain services are unavailable

## Dependencies
- `ethers` library for Ethereum interactions
- Smart contract deployment and management
- Blockchain network configuration

## Status
- [ ] Re-implement EthereumProvider
- [ ] Re-implement BlockchainEscrowService  
- [ ] Re-implement NonCustodialEscrowManager
- [ ] Re-implement EscrowContractABI
- [ ] Add blockchain service tests
- [ ] Update service exports
